### Carl Sagan (1934 - 1996)

The most important task our global civilisation faces is preserving the lives and well-being of its citizens and the future habitability of the planet. If we are willing to live with the growing likelihood of [social, economic and environmental collapse], shouldn't we also be willing to explore vigorously every possible means to prevent those things? Shouldn't we consider in every nation major changes in the traditional ways of doing things, a fundamental restructuring of economic, political, social institutions? We have reached a point where there can be no more special interests or special cases. This coming century's challenges threaten everyone.

Fundamental changes in society are sometimes labelled impractical or contrary to human nature — as if environmental destruction and social injustice were practical or as if there were only a single human nature. But fundamental changes can clearly be made. We are surrounded by them. In the last three centuries abject slavery, which was with us for thousands of years, has entirely been eliminated in a stirring world wide revolution. Women, systematically mistreated for millennia, have gradually gained the political and economic power traditionally denied to them. The old appeals to racial, sexual and religious chauvinism and to rabid nationalism are beginning not to work. A new consciousness is developing which sees the humanity as a single group and recognises that a group at war with itself is doomed.

We are one planet. We all speak for Earth.


### Arthur C. Clarke (1917 - 2008)

Well... now we need a new way of getting along. It’s all different now. Perhaps it has been the culmination of tensions that had been building up for centuries among an increasingly interconnected humankind. Now it has proven possible to shut down the discussion.

Everything is fluid. There are new factions, new interest and new groups. The last barriers between the old nations are being kicked down. Across the world people are ignoring the old categories, and are uniting with others with whom they find common cause, whichever country they happen to live in. An interconnected democracy is taking over, a mass, self-correcting wisdom - whether we like it or not.

We do not want a world government, I don’t think. What we do need are new mechanisms, new political forms to recognise the new fluidity. No more power centres. No more secrets.

We still need mechanisms to unify us, to ensure justice and equality of resource and opportunity — and fast-response agencies when crises hit. But we need ways to cope with threats without sacrificing our liberties.

We have no precedent for how a civilisation spanning the whole world, or several, is supposed to run itself. I like to think that this is the next stage in our maturity as a culture.

Openness. That’s the watchword now.
